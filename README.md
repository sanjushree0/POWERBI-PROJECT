 Supply Chain & Inventory Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing inventory data for a manufacturing company operating across multiple warehouses. The company faces two major challenges: frequent stock-outs causing delivery delays and overstocking leading to high holding costs.
The goal of this project is to use data analytics and visualization to support better inventory decision-making.

 Objectives

As a Supply Chain Analyst, the project aims to:

Monitor inventory levels across warehouses

Identify low-stock and overstocked products

Detect stock-out patterns by warehouse

Improve inventory turnover

Identify slow-moving products

Support data-driven reorder and inventory optimization decisions

 Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Excel – Sample data creation and preprocessing

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard design

DAX – Inventory KPIs and classification logic

 Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

Product details (Product ID, Product Name, Category)

Warehouse information

Inventory snapshot data (On-hand units, Reorder point, Max level)

Sales and demand data

Stock movement indicators

Sample data is provided in Excel format and used to build the Power BI report.

 Key KPIs (Cards)

Inventory Turnover Rate

Low Stock Items Count

Fill Rate (%)

Total On-Hand Units

Total On-Order Units

Total Inventory Value

These KPIs provide a quick snapshot of overall inventory health.

 Visual Analysis & Insights
 Products Below Reorder Point

Table & filters highlight products that require immediate replenishment.

2️ Univariate Analysis of Stock Levels

Histogram (OnHandUnits bins) shows the distribution of inventory across products.

3️ Warehouse Stock-Out Analysis

Bar chart (Stockout Count by Warehouse) identifies warehouses with frequent stock shortages.

4️ Stock Status Classification

Products are classified as Low, Optimal, or Excess using DAX logic based on reorder point and maximum stock level.

5️ Inventory Turnover Trend

Line chart (by Month & Year) tracks inventory efficiency over time.

6️ Demand vs Sales Trend

Line chart compares total demand vs units sold to highlight stock-out impact.

7️ Slow-Moving Products Identification

Scatter chart (Average Inventory Value vs Units Sold) identifies products with high inventory but low sales.

8️ Overstock & Holding Cost Risk

Category-level analysis shows where excess inventory value is concentrated.

 Business Impact

Helps reduce holding costs by identifying excess and slow-moving inventory

Prevents stock-outs through early identification of low-stock items

Improves inventory turnover with data-backed insights

Enables better warehouse-level planning and replenishment decisions
